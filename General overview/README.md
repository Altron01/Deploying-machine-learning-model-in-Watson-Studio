## General overview of Watson Studio
This section covers the Watson Studio project structure. We will go tab by tab explaining what they contain and their functions.

Note: I am assuming that you already have an IBM account and provisioned a Watson Studio instance

### Overview tab

As its name says, this tab gives general information about the project. On the right section of the window we have a list of recent activity our project has gone through so any assets modification should appear in this sections for quick viewing, on the left below there is a ReadMe section so make sure to document the project here to ease the work for other developers

### Assets

In this section we have a list of all our assets divided by its category. Watson Studio have a broad range of assets that will help you in your data science experience. The most basic one is the notebook to write code in R/Python but you also have database connection, image classificator, automatic machine learning model generator, descision optimization and many more.

### Environment

The environment tab list all our different environment, their computing capabilities, language and modules. A wonderful feature of Watson Studio is the custom environment that we can build, just like a virtual env in anaconda. In this tab we could also check on the amount of CUH we have used and how many we had available. CUH are a sort of computing credit provisioned for our project, the CUH used is defined by the computing power of our env.

Note: every project come with free 50 CUH per month.
